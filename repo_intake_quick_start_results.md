✅ Quick start test completed successfully!

This test demonstrated the full, unified architecture:
1. A high-level task was sent to the Intelligent Router.
2. The router analyzed the task and delegated it to the correct specialist agent (`RepoIntakeAgent`).
3. The specialist agent executed its logic and returned a structured result.
4. All actions were tracked via the centralized analytics system.

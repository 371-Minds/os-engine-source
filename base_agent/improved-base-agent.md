371 OS Improved Base Agent Implementation
Overview
This document presents an enhanced version of the 371 OS BaseAgent with significant performance optimizations, monitoring capabilities, and reliability improvements based on comprehensive benchmark testing and industry best practices.

Key Improvements
ðŸš€ Performance Optimizations
Concurrent Task Processing
Removed blocking is_busy flag that prevented parallel task execution

Implemented priority-based task queue with configurable concurrency limits

Added semaphore-controlled worker pool for efficient resource management

Background worker processes handle multiple tasks simultaneously

Connection Management
Connection pooling for LLM API calls reduces connection overhead

Configurable pool size (default: 10 connections)

Automatic connection reuse and lifecycle management

Caching System
TTL-based cache for frequently accessed data (default: 1 hour TTL)

LRU eviction policy when cache reaches size limits

Cache hit/miss ratio tracking for optimization insights

Circuit Breaker Pattern
Automatic failure detection and service protection

Configurable failure thresholds and timeout periods

Self-healing mechanism with automatic recovery attempts

Real-time Monitoring
System resource tracking (CPU, memory usage)

Task throughput measurement (tasks per second)

Response time analysis and trend monitoring

Error rate calculation and alerting

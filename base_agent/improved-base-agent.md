=== BASE AGENT ANALYSIS ===

1. ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS:
- Uses ABC (Abstract Base Class) pattern for modularity ✓
- Implements async/await patterns for concurrency ✓
- Has proper logging and error handling ✓
- Uses dataclasses for structured data ✓
- Includes task status tracking ✓

2. POTENTIAL PERFORMANCE BOTTLENECKS:
- Sequential task execution (self.is_busy flag blocks parallel processing)
- No connection pooling for LLM calls
- No caching mechanism for repetitive operations
- No rate limiting or backoff strategies
- No metrics collection for performance monitoring
- Limited error recovery and retry mechanisms

3. SCALABILITY CONCERNS:
- Single-threaded agent execution model
- No load balancing across multiple agent instances
- No resource usage monitoring (CPU, memory)
- No health check implementation details provided
- Task queue could become a bottleneck without proper sizing

4. MONITORING GAPS:
- No performance metrics collection
- No request/response time tracking
- No throughput measurements
- No error rate monitoring
- No resource utilization tracking

371 Minds OS Content and Marketing System Architecture

371 Minds OS Content and Marketing System Architecture

1 . Core stacks that power the subsystem
Layer	Key package(s)	What it handles
Content Generation Engine	content_generation_engine.py	AI prompt-to-copy, brand voice enforcement, platform-length optimisation
Email Marketing System	email_marketing_system.py	Segmentation, A/B testing, nurture workflows, rate-limited delivery
Social Media System	social_media_system.py	Post optimiser, scheduler with best-time model, multi-platform publisher
Content Strategy Manager	Vector search + trend-analyser agent	Fills calendars, predicts performance, feeds Generator with briefs
Analytics Bus	Realtime event pipes ‚Üí Convex ‚Üí PostHog	Normalises opens, clicks, likes, ROI back to Router for next actions
All components inherit the same Base-Agent contract used across 371 Minds, so the Intelligent Routing System can orchestrate them just like any other specialised execution system.

2 . Email automation: what an agent can do now
Auto-build segments - contacts are bucketed into New Subscribers, High-Value, Dormant, etc. using live behaviour rules ^1.
Compose & personalise - the PersonalisationEngine merges brand templates with MemoryPlugin fields (preferences, tier) for human-sounding mail.
A/B test or predictive send - optional split logic; or enable send-time AI that delivers when each contact usually opens ^3.
Rate-safe delivery - DeliveryEngine respects SES/Mailgun/Resend throttles; queues overflow automatically.
Closed-loop metrics - opens, clicks, spam, unsubscribes stored in EmailMetrics; Router can trigger ‚Äúre-engage‚Äù workflow if engagement < threshold.
Example quick-start:

campaign = EmailCampaign(
    campaign_id="spring_launch",
    name="Spring Launch",
    email_type=EmailType.NEWSLETTER,
    template_id="tpl_spring24",
    target_segments=[SegmentType.NEW_SUBSCRIBERS, SegmentType.ACTIVE_USERS],
    send_time=datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(hours=1),
    personalization_rules={"cta":"shop_now"}
)
system.create_campaign(campaign)
await system.send_campaign("spring_launch")
3 . Social posting: idea ‚Üí live in one call
Optimise copy length & hashtags for each platform automatically ^4.
Pick best-time slot with PostScheduler (per-platform heuristics + engagement model).
Publish concurrently with credential isolation via the Secure Credential Warehouse.
Monitor reactions every hour; negative-sentiment spikes route to Customer-Support agents.
post = social_system.create_post(
    "üöÄ New feature just dropped‚Äîzero-config CI/CD!",
    [Platform.TWITTER, Platform.LINKEDIN],
    hashtags=["DevOps","AIPlatform"]
)
social_system.schedule_post(post)  # auto-picks next optimal window
4 . Human-in-the-Loop checkpoints
‚ÄúContent Approval‚Äù ‚Äì Generator queues drafts; you approve in Admin UI or via Slack slash-command.
‚ÄúBrand Review‚Äù ‚Äì long-form assets (> 800 words) flagged for voice scan.
‚ÄúCampaign Validation‚Äù ‚Äì before any list > 10 k contacts is mailed, CASH (CFO) agent surfaces projected LLM + email-provider cost.
5 . Typical end-to-end flow
You: ‚ÄúLaunch July promo for PowerUsers.‚Äù
Router‚ÜíContent Strategy agent: pulls last-year July data, trending keywords, returns brief.
Content Generation Engine drafts email + 3 social snippets.
Human checkpoint: you thumbs-up copy.
Email system builds segment ‚ÄúHIGH_VALUE users‚Äù and schedules send with predictive timing.
Social system schedules LinkedIn + X posts at peak engagement.
Analytics bus streams opens/CTR; under-performing variant auto-switched after 500 sends.
PostHog dashboard benchmarks campaign ROI; Router logs savings to CFO.
6 . Plug-in points
LLM choice ‚Äì OpenAI, Anthropic, or local Mistral via environment variable AI_ENDPOINT.
Email provider ‚Äì swap SendGrid/Mailgun/Resend in DeliveryEngine.
Social APIs ‚Äì default uses Mixpost keys from Credential Warehouse, but Buffer/Hootsuite APIs are one-line adapters.
External CMS ‚Äì content can be pushed to Contentful via webhook; storefront landing pages auto-update.
7 . Next steps
Install components into the monorepo (/marketing/ folder); run unit tests.
Wire Router rules: intents ‚Äúsend_email‚Äù, ‚Äúpost_social‚Äù, ‚Äúplan_content‚Äù.
Populate brand templates + voice guidelines YAML.
Connect email provider + Mixpost tokens in Credential Warehouse.
Schedule first pilot: Welcome-series nurture (3-email sequence) for new sign-ups.
The Content & Marketing subsystem is now scaffolded‚Äîonce merged, 371 Minds agents can plan, create, publish, and optimise marketing assets without human toil while still giving you veto power at every crucial step.
